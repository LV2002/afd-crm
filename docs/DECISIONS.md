# Decisions

Two kinds of entry live here.

**Section A** is for Leon. These are business decisions Claude Code will otherwise invent
defaults for, and you'll be stuck with them. Fill them in before Session 3.

**Section B** is for Claude Code. Any time a requirement is ambiguous, write the assumption
here with a date and move on. Do not stall waiting for an answer.

## A. Decisions Leon must make

### A1. Pipeline stages — final names and order
Proposed in `00-PRD.md` §4. Edit this list to match how AFD actually works.

| # | Stage | Type | Keep / change |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | New | new | |
| 2 | Assigned | normal | |
| 3 | Attempted | normal | |
| 4 | Connected | normal | |
| 5 | Qualified | normal | |
| 6 | Counselling Scheduled | scheduled | |
| 7 | Counselling Done / Visited | normal | |
| 8 | Fee Discussed | normal | |
| 9 | Registration Form Sent | enrolment_form | |
| 10 | Form Submitted | normal | |
| 11 | Payment Pending | payment | |
| 12 | Enrolled | won | |
| 13 | Lost | lost | |
| 14 | Nurture / Dormant | parked | |

**Decision:**

### A2. Stage probabilities (for weighted forecast)
Rough is fine. What % of leads at each stage historically end up enrolling?

**Decision:**

### A3. Lost reasons — final list
Proposed: Fee too high · Joined competitor · Chose different career · Distance ·
Parent declined · Wrong exam year · Not eligible · Unreachable · Duplicate · Other

**Decision:**

### A4. Mandatory fields on lead creation
Be strict. Loose data now is unfixable later. Suggested minimum: student name, phone,
source. Consider also: district, exam year, education status.

**Decision:**

### A5. SLA hours
Default: first response 24h, escalate at 12 / 24 / 48. Right for AFD?

**Decision:**

### A6. Lead score weightings
See `01-DATA-MODEL.md` § Lead score. Which signals matter most for AFD?

**Decision:**

### A7. Who holds which role
Name real people. Note that `co_admin` sees everything across all centres.

| Person | Role | Centres |
|---|---|---|
| Leon | admin | all |
| | | |

**Decision:**

### A8. Discount authority limits
Above what discount does a counsellor need approval? Centre head? Who approves?

**Decision:**

### A9. Courses × fee structure
Course list is in the seed data. Fee per course × centre × mode × academic year is not.
Needed before Phase 4, not before Phase 1.

**Decision:**

## B. Assumptions made during the build

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD · [area] assumption · why · how to reverse`
